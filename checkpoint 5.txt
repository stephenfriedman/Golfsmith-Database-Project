PROJECT CHECKPOINT #5

I have 1 interface working. It is a cashier's interface
that they would use at the checkout counter to enter
in the info of a new customer. My databases are all populated
but I still need to write triggers. I will be working
on adding the necessary triggers to implement about
5 interfaces total. I do not see much last minute debugging coming
into play. I have submitted my project TEST SUBMISSION on 4/13 and 
am awating feedback from the graders.
